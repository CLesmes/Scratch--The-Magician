# Scratch--The-Magician
Week 0 project in Scratch.  
This is my first project in CS50  in scratch for week 0.

The theme is 'The magician"
The idea is an apprenticed of magic that meet a friend an try to show her his new tricks and move from one place to another place.
I think similar project can be done as futurist when possible to go to different places using tele transportation.
Why did I chose this theme , really it's more to try the scratch sprites and easily and if any mistakes could be look like funny, I can say it's not so easy to make looks funny.

The project starts when two friend meet and say hello
then guy ask the girl where she wants to go and then as she answers one of the options he gave them they move... to the selected place.... for this you have to play to find out.
